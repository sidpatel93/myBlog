## Starting my journey to become Software Developer

Hi everyone, this is my very first post in my journey to become the Software Engineer/Developer. 
My educational background is in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, but ever since I was in the undergraduate school, I was fascinated with the computers. After I finished the undergraduate, I went to pursue a graduate degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering.  

I worked as a Product Engineer for a Manufacturing Company for almost 5 years after graduating from college, but my interest in the computer programming remains. I used to follow web development tutorials from youtube and udemy in free time. When I first started, I did not know where to start and what resources are best for learning how to code.  

Then I bought this book [Python Crash Course](https://nostarch.com/pythoncrashcourse2e). I think this is one of the best best book for a beginner who would like to learn the fundamental concepts about computer programming, basic in-built datastructures and Object Oriented Programming. Later I decided to get formal education in the Computer Science, so I started Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, which is currently in progrress.  

I have created this blog hoping that I will share the content and resources I am using with you all. 
I hope you will find a thing or two in my posts. It would be diffifult to cram all the resources in one blog post, so I will distribute them among various posts with appropriate tags and categories. You can search the posts by category on the navigation bar.  

I am by no means expert or professional in the field of Software Engineering. I truly appreciate if you can share your thoughts with me as well in the comments or contact me via email.  

## First Step: Creating a Blog

I know it can be quite intemedating to get stated while you are learning to code.
In my opinion, it would be quite beneficial if you can create your personal blog early in your learning journey and share the content with others. 
This will give you kind of accountability and push you to go further. I am little late to get this blog started, but as the saying goes:   

{{< blockquote author="Chinese Proverb" >}}“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.” {{</blockquote>}}

I am using a framework called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) to create this blog. 
It does not have all the bells and whistles that Wordpress offers, but requires much less time setting up and get started compare to Wordpress, which has little learning curve.

Furthermore, I am using a theme called [Papermod](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-papermod/). This is amazing and simplistic theme for hugo. You can develop your blog locally to test it. Once you satisfied, then you can purchase a domain name Sites like [HostGator](https://www.hostgator.com/) or [Google Domain](https://domains.google.com/registrar/) and host it on the internet. I have this site hosted on the GitHub Pages, which allows you to host a static site for free.  

I hope the information here is a enough to nudge you in the right direction for creating a blog. If you have any specific question about any of the process mentioned in this post, please feel free to comment below and I will get back to you with detailed explanation.
