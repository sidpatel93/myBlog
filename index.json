[{"content":"Starting my journey to become Software Developer Hi everyone, this is my very first post in my journey to become the Software Engineer/Developer. My educational background is in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, but ever since I was in the undergraduate school, I was fascinated with the computers. After I finished the undergraduate, I went to pursue a graduate degree in Industrial and Systems Engineering.\nI worked as a Product Engineer for a Manufacturing Company for almost 5 years after graduating from college, but my interest in the computer programming remains. I used to follow web development tutorials from youtube and udemy in free time. When I first started, I did not know where to start and what resources are best for learning how to code.\nThen I bought this book Python Crash Course. I think this is one of the best best book for a beginner who would like to learn the fundamental concepts about computer programming, basic in-built datastructures and Object Oriented Programming. Later I decided to get formal education in the Computer Science, so I started Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Institute of Technology, which is currently in progrress.\nI have created this blog hoping that I will share the content and resources I am using with you all. I hope you will find a thing or two in my posts. It would be diffifult to cram all the resources in one blog post, so I will distribute them among various posts with appropriate tags and categories. You can search the posts by category on the navigation bar.\nI am by no means expert or professional in the field of Software Engineering. I truly appreciate if you can share your thoughts with me as well in the comments or contact me via email.\nFirst Step: Creating a Blog I know it can be quite intemedating to get stated while you are learning to code. In my opinion, it would be quite beneficial if you can create your personal blog early in your learning journey and share the content with others. This will give you kind of accountability and push you to go further. I am little late to get this blog started, but as the saying goes:\n ‚ÄúThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is now.‚Äù\n Chinese Proverb   I am using a framework called Hugo to create this blog. It does not have all the bells and whistles that Wordpress offers, but requires much less time setting up and get started compare to Wordpress, which has little learning curve.\nFurthermore, I am using a theme called Papermod. This is amazing and simplistic theme for hugo. You can develop your blog locally to test it. Once you satisfied, then you can purchase a domain name Sites like HostGator or Google Domain and host it on the internet. I have this site hosted on the GitHub Pages, which allows you to host a static site for free.\nI hope the information here is a enough to nudge you in the right direction for creating a blog. If you have any specific question about any of the process mentioned in this post, please feel free to comment below and I will get back to you with detailed explanation.\n","permalink":"https://blog.sidpatel.org/posts/helloworld/","summary":"Starting my journey to become Software Developer Hi everyone, this is my very first post in my journey to become the Software Engineer/Developer.

I had general understading of the web application and how they are built, but I always wanted to build one from ground up with some of the advance features like real time communication using Web Sockets, user Sessions and Cookie management, integrating text message api, asynchronous operations and more. Furthermore, I wanted to sharpen my skills for AWS by deploying the complete app on AWS platform using some of the core services like EC2 instances, RDS Database, DynanoDB, Route 53 etc.\nYou can find this application running live on üçï Pizza-N-Go\nLet me start from the features and working of this applicaiton, and then I will try to explain the technology I\u0026rsquo;ve used later.\nApplication ¬†This application consist of platform where users and admin(Pizza-n-go restaurant) can interact with each other. First there is a functionality for a user to sign up and login from the homepage. Admin credentials are hardcoded in the database, so all the new users created from the sign-up form will be have assigned role as \u0026lsquo;users\u0026rsquo;.\nFrom the homepage it may look simple, but when you login as a user or as an admin, the portal you interact would be different. Below I have shown two screens side-by-side. On the right a user has itms in carts and on the left this is how restaurant would see their portal. Notice that restaurant has different functionalities than a regular user, where they can track or adjust the status of the orders.\nYou can notice that when a user adding items in cart, the cart in the navbar is also updating at the same time. To place an order, user have to be logged in. The user cart is managed by user sessions. I will explain about this later in backend technology section.\nOnce a user place an order, they will be redirected to order tracking page. This page shows the order id and other details about the order. Along with this web message, a SMS will be sent to customer cell number that they used while registering. At the same time, the restaurant will receive the notification about the new order. This communication between user and restaurant happens in realtime with Web Socket protocol.\nFrom here, a restaurant can set an estimated time it will require to fullfill this order. When a restarant set the time and click \u0026lsquo;send SMS\u0026rsquo; button, the status of order will be changed from \u0026lsquo;New\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;In-Progress\u0026rsquo; and a user will receive text message about this change along with update on the web portal.\nAt last, restaurant has an order ready, they can click \u0026lsquo;ready to pickup\u0026rsquo; on their portal. This will move the order from \u0026lsquo;In-Progress\u0026rsquo; to \u0026lsquo;Completed\u0026rsquo; state and a use receive notification for order pick up on phone and web portal.\nFrontend The front of the application is build using simple HTML, CSS, client side JavaScript and EJS templating engine for JavaScript. All the pictures and details about the food you see on the page is stored in the database. When a user visit the page, the browser will send a request to server asking for required HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.\nThere is a logic written these JavaScript files that make asynchronous request to server asking for the images for food and detail to show on the page. I have used a library called Axios to fetch the data.\nNow let\u0026rsquo;s move to the backend or server side logic. This is where all the magic happens.\n","permalink":"https://blog.sidpatel.org/portfolios/pizza-n-go/","summary":"I would admit, the picture above looks delicious, isn\u0026rsquo;t it ?\nI like to present the food ordering application I have created to learn FullStack Web Development.
